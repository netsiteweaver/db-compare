# db-compare
Small script in PHP to compare 2 databases

Very often we found ourself in a situation where we don't remember what changes have been made to a database, especially if this is an old project. My aim is to be able to compare the new database schema to the new and generate the code necessary to update the old database.

In the initial version I will be simply listing the schema and will be adding the features progressively

Any ideas or contributions are most welcome!
