# db-compare
Small script in PHP to compare 2 databases

Very often we find ourself in a situation where we've lost track of changes made to a database, especially if this is an old project or when there have been multiple developers on the project. My aim is to be able to compare the new database schema to the new and generate the sql code necessary to update the old database.

In the initial version I will be simply listing the schema and will be adding the features progressively

Any ideas or contributions are most welcome!
